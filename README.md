(YOU NEED THE AUTOHOTKEY APPLICATION FOR THE SCRIPTS TO WORK)start both ahk files by opening them, then when in your server press minus button, after starter starts it will be in a loop, do not press wasd or the arrow keys until you stop it with =  (do not press - or = at the same time, dont press - and = multiple times) i cant make it more foolproof atm so just try not to mess up.

\ button toggles UI nav incase you wanna get out the mode or put it back on.
