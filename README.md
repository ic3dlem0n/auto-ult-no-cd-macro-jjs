start both ahk files by opening them, then when in your server press minus button, after starter finishes press equal button
which toggles the auto ult no cd, to turn off the macro press the equal button again.

\ button toggles UI nav incase you wanna get out the mode or put it back on. I cant make the macro do it at the moment.
Thanks for using, more detailed guide on https://www.youtube.com/@blebebeb
ONLY FOR WINDOWS cause ahk only on windows, ill make a mac version in the future since i use that too.
